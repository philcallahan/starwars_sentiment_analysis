# Star Wars Movie Critics' Sentiment Analysis (Original Trilogy) vs. Box Office Earnings
From previous research into the movie industry (network analysis on three recently
released movies), I had come across differing viewpoints on the importance of criticsâ€™ reviews and what
role they play in creating buzz for a movie (if any). To investigate this, I decided to track down datasets
aggregating critic reviews and compare that with box office revenue for the original Star Wars trilogy. This shed some light on the
(un)importance of critics since ultimately only box office totals matter to the movie makers.
